1. pnpm -g install @fluencelabs/cli@latest

it's a bit confusing, but when it shows your fie path in '()' you can just type a name you want the folder to be.

then: Change into your new 'named' directory and have a look around:

3. now in 'named' directory run to create a service:
fluence service new peace_world

marine set up:
# install the Rust compiler and tools to `~/.cargo/bin`
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# add Rust tools to the current PATH
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# install the nightly toolchain (the x86_64 suffix is needed for compatibility with M1, and 2022-09-15 because newer rust generates wasm we temporarily do not support) 
rustup install nightly-2022-09-15-x86_64




To be able to use generate subcommand of marine, install the cargo-generate tool:

# install cargo-generate target for the marine tool
cargo install cargo-generate
Then, install marine and mrepl:

# install marine
    cargo +nightly-2022-09-15-x86_64 install marine
# install mrepl, it requires nightly toolchain
cargo +nightly-2022-09-15-x86_64 install mrepl


when i tried the above , i got an error and it references needing to use '--locked' so i ran:
cargo +nightly-2022-09-15-x86_64 install marine --locked
