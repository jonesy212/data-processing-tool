# Calendar Application: Understanding Event Handling

In our calendar application, event handling plays a crucial role in managing user interactions and ensuring a smooth user experience. Let's delve into the different types of events used in our application and understand their significance.

## Event 1: Custom Mouse Event

**Description:** Event 1 represents a custom mouse event specifically designed for interactions within the calendar interface.

**Use Case Scenario:**
Suppose the user wants to interact with a specific event on the calendar, such as clicking on it to view more details or dragging it to reschedule. In this case, Event 1 would handle these interactions. For example, clicking on an event would trigger the `customEvent()` method to dispatch the event, allowing the application to respond accordingly.

**Implementation:**
- Defined as a custom mouse event (`CustomMouseEvent`) with additional properties and methods tailored for calendar interactions.
- Includes properties like `id`, `title`, `description`, `startDate`, and `endDate`, which are essential for representing calendar events.
- Provides methods like `customEvent()` to handle event dispatching and `preventDefaultEvent()` to prevent default behavior.

## Event 2: Generic Event Object

**Description:** Event 2 represents a generic event object that adheres to the standard `Event` interface.

**Use Case Scenario:**
In the calendar application, Event 2 might be used for handling general DOM events or interactions outside of the calendar component itself. For instance, it could be used to handle events related to navigating through different views of the calendar, such as switching between day, week, or month views.

**Implementation:**
- Event 2 is a standard `Event` object with properties and methods defined by the standard DOM event interface.
- Lacks custom properties specific to calendar events like `id` or `startDate`, but provides essential functionality for handling events within the application.

## Example Usage

```typescript
const eventService = new EventService();

// Event 1: Custom Mouse Event
const event1: CustomMouseEvent = {
  id: "event1",
  title: "Event 1",
  description: "Event Description 1",
  startDate: new Date(),
  endDate: new Date(),
  // Additional properties and methods specific to Event 1
};

// Event 2: Generic Event Object
const event2: Event = {
  // Properties and methods adhering to the standard Event interface
};
