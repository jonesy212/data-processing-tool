### Registration Phase Component

The `RegistrationPhase` component serves as a user registration form in a React application. Let's break down its functionality and how it utilizes phase transitions:

#### Registration Form

The component renders a form with fields for username, password, and confirmation password. It handles user input and provides validation to ensure that the passwords match before submission. Upon successful registration, the user is redirected to a questionnaire submission page.

```jsx
// Render registration form
return (
  <div>
    <h2>Sign Up</h2>
    {error && <div style={{ color: "red" }}>{error}</div>}
    <form>
      {/* Username input */}
      <label>
        Username:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={username}
          onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <br />
      {/* Password input */}
      <label>
        Password:
        <input
          type="password"
          value={password}
          onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <br />
      {/* Confirm password input */}
      <label>
        Confirm Password:
        <input
          type="password"
          value={confirmPassword}
          onChange={(e) => setConfirmPassword(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <br />
      {/* Sign up button */}
      <button type="button" onClick={handleRegister} disabled={loading}>
        {loading ? "Loading..." : "Sign Up"}
      </button>
    </form>
    {/* Email setup form */}
    <EmailSetupForm handleRegisterEmail={handleRegister} />
    {/* Link to sign-in page */}
    <div>
      Already have an account? <Link to="/signin">Sign In</Link>
    </div>
    {/* Buttons for phase transitions */}
    <button onClick={moveToNextPhase}>Move to Next Phase</button>
    <button onClick={moveToPreviousPhase}>Move to Previous Phase</button>
  </div>
);
Phase Transitions
The component utilizes phase transitions to manage the registration process efficiently. These transitions are facilitated by phase hooks, specifically enhancedPhaseHook.

Moving to Next Phase
jsx
Copy code
// Function to handle transitioning to the next phase
const moveToNextPhase = () => {
  // Define the next phase configuration
  const nextPhaseConfig: PhaseHookConfig = {
    condition: () => true, // Define condition for the next phase
    asyncEffect: async () => {
      return () => Promise.resolve(); // Return a function that resolves the Promise
    },
    name: "NextPhase", // Name of the next phase
    duration: 0, // Duration of the next phase if needed
  };

  // Check if transition to next phase is allowed
  if (enhancedPhaseHook.canTransitionTo(nextPhaseConfig)) {
    // Transition to next phase
    enhancedPhaseHook.handleTransitionTo(nextPhaseConfig);
    setCurrentPhase(nextPhaseConfig); // Update the current phase in local state
  }
};
Moving to Previous Phase
jsx
Copy code
// Function to handle transitioning to the previous phase
const moveToPreviousPhase = () => {
  // Define the previous phase configuration
  const previousPhaseConfig: PhaseHookConfig = {
    condition: () => true, // Define condition for the previous phase
    asyncEffect: async () => {
      return () => Promise.resolve(); // Return a function that resolves the Promise
    },
    name: "PreviousPhase", // Name of the previous phase
    duration: 0, // Duration of the previous phase if needed
  };

  // Check if transition to previous phase is allowed
  if (enhancedPhaseHook.canTransitionTo(previousPhaseConfig)) {
    // Transition to previous phase
    enhancedPhaseHook.handleTransitionTo(previousPhaseConfig);
    setCurrentPhase(previousPhaseConfig); // Update the current phase in local state
  }
};
Benefits of Phase Transitions
Utilizing phase transitions in the registration process offers several advantages:

Progressive User Journey: Users can move forward or backward in the registration process based on specific conditions, providing a smoother and more intuitive experience.

Conditional Logic: By checking conditions before transitioning to the next or previous phase, the component ensures that users proceed only when it's appropriate, enhancing the reliability of the registration flow.

Flexible Architecture: The use of phase transitions with phase hooks allows for a flexible and modular architecture, making it easier to extend or modify the registration process in the future.

Phase Hooks Integration
The integration of phase hooks, specifically enhancedPhaseHook, enhances the manageability and flexibility of the registration process. These hooks encapsulate phase-specific logic and facilitate smooth transitions between different phases, ensuring a seamless user experience.
