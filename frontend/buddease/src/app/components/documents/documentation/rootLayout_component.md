### RootLayout Component

The `RootLayout` component serves as the top-level layout wrapper for the entire application. It encapsulates logic related to theme configuration, document generation, and dynamic component rendering. Its responsibilities include:

1. **Theme Configuration:** 
   - Manages theme-related settings such as primary and secondary colors, font size, and font family dynamically based on user preferences.
   
2. **Document Generation:** 
   - Facilitates document generation functionality, allowing users to generate documents based on predefined templates and data inputs.
   
3. **Dynamic Component Rendering:** 
   - Dynamically renders different layout configurations based on the application's dynamic component settings, adapting the layout structure and behavior to accommodate various configurations and user preferences.

### Layout Component

The `Layout` component is responsible for rendering common UI elements such as headers, footers, and main content areas within specific pages or components. Its primary purpose is to provide a consistent layout structure across different sections of the application. Key features of the `Layout` component include:

1. **Common UI Elements:** 
   - Renders essential UI elements shared across multiple pages, such as headers containing application branding or navigation links, main content areas for displaying page-specific content, and footers with additional information or links.
   
2. **Flexibility:** 
   - Offers flexibility in organizing and presenting content within the application, accommodating variations in page layouts while maintaining consistency in the overall design and user experience.
   
3. **Integration with Specific Pages:** 
   - Seamlessly integrates with specific pages or components to provide a cohesive user interface. By wrapping page content with the `Layout` component, developers can ensure a uniform layout structure and visual appearance throughout the application.
