## User Scenario: Exporting Calendar Data to XLSX with Metadata

### Introduction:
Sarah is a project manager at a software development company. She uses a calendar application to track project milestones, deadlines, and team member schedules. Sarah's calendar application allows her to customize the display settings, such as choosing different color themes, setting working hours, and adjusting the time zone.

### User Need:
Sarah needs to share the project schedule with her team and other stakeholders in a format that is easy to understand and analyze.

### Solution:
Sarah decides to export the calendar data to an XLSX file using the `formatCalendarAsXLSX` function. She includes important metadata, such as `calendarDisplaySettings`, to provide context to the recipients about how the calendar events are displayed.

### Code Example:
```javascript
import * as XLSX from 'xlsx';
import { WritableDraft } from "../state/redux/ReducerGenerator";
import { CalendarEvent } from "../state/stores/CalendarEvent";
import { SimpleCalendarEvent } from "./CalendarContext";

// Function to format calendar data as XLSX binary string
export const formatCalendarAsXLSX = (
  events: (WritableDraft<SimpleCalendarEvent> | WritableDraft<CalendarEvent>)[],
  calendarDisplaySettings: CalendarDisplaySettings
): string => {
  // Create a new workbook
  const workbook = XLSX.utils.book_new();
  
  // Convert events to a worksheet
  const worksheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(events);

  // Add the worksheet to the workbook
  XLSX.utils.book_append_sheet(workbook, worksheet, 'Calendar Events');

  // Include calendar display settings as metadata
  const metaData = {
    CalendarDisplaySettings: calendarDisplaySettings
  };

  // Ensure metaData is compatible with Properties
  const metaDataWithProperties: XLSX.FullProperties & typeof metaData = metaData;

  // Convert the workbook to XLSX binary string
  const xlsxData = XLSX.write(workbook, { type: 'binary', Props: metaDataWithProperties });

  return xlsxData;
};
Benefits:
Clarity: Recipients can easily understand and analyze the project schedule in a familiar spreadsheet format.
Context: Including calendarDisplaySettings metadata provides context about how the calendar events are displayed, enhancing understanding.
Usability: The exported XLSX file can be easily shared and accessed by team members and stakeholders for reference and analysis.
This user scenario demonstrates how the formatCalendarAsXLSX function and the inclusion of metadata can benefit users like Sarah in sharing and understanding calendar data.
