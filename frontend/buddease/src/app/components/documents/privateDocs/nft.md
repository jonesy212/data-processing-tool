Here's a brief overview of each directory and its contents:

Frontend:

components: Contains React components related to NFT conversion.
services: Contains service functions for handling NFT-related operations.
utils: Contains utility functions for NFT conversion.
Solidity:

contracts: Contains the Solidity smart contract for NFT management.
tests: Contains Solidity smart contract tests.
Backend:

models: Contains SQLAlchemy models for NFT-related database tables.
controllers: Contains API controllers for handling NFT-related requests.
services: Contains service functions for interacting with the database and performing NFT-related operations.
utils: Contains utility functions for NFT-related tasks.
Based on this structure, you can create the necessary files and implement the functionality for the NFT feature across frontend, Solidity, and backend using Python, SQL, and SQLAlchemy.
