# TreeView Component Documentation

The TreeView component is used to display hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. It allows users to navigate through the data and perform actions such as searching, pagination, and expanding/collapsing tree nodes.

## Installation

To use the TreeView component in your React application, you need to install it as follows:

```bash
pnpm install @/app/components/TreeView
Usage
Import the TreeView component and use it in your React application as shown below:

jsx
Copy code
import TreeView from '@/app/components/TreeView';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // Define your data
  const data = [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: 'Node 1',
      children: [
        {
          id: 2,
          name: 'Node 1.1',
          children: [
            {
              id: 3,
              name: 'Node 1.1.1',
              children: [],
            },
          ],
        },
        {
          id: 4,
          name: 'Node 1.2',
          children: [],
        },
      ],
    },
    // Add more nodes as needed
  ];

  const handleNodeClick = (node) => {
    // Handle node click event
    console.log('Clicked node:', node);
  };

  return <TreeView data={data} onClick={handleNodeClick} />;
};

export default MyComponent;
Features
Search
The TreeView component allows users to search for specific nodes within the tree. Simply type the search query in the search input field, and the tree will filter the nodes accordingly.

Pagination
When dealing with a large dataset, the TreeView component supports pagination to improve performance and user experience. You can navigate between pages using the pagination controls.

Example:

Click on "Next" to move to the next page.
Click on "Previous" to go back to the previous page.
Use "First" and "Last" buttons to quickly navigate to the first and last pages, respectively.
Node Interaction
Users can interact with individual nodes by clicking on them. This can be useful for expanding/collapsing nodes or triggering specific actions associated with the nodes.

Example
Consider a scenario where you have a directory structure representing files and folders. You want to display this structure in a TreeView component, allowing users to search for files/folders, navigate through pages, and view details of each item.

jsx
Copy code
import TreeView from '@/app/components/TreeView';

const DirectoryExplorer = () => {
  // Assume directory data is fetched from an API
  const directoryData = [
    // Directory structure data
  ];

  // Handle node click event
  const handleNodeClick = (node) => {
    // Implement node click functionality
    console.log('Clicked node:', node);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Directory Explorer</h2>
      <TreeView data={directoryData} onClick={handleNodeClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default DirectoryExplorer;
In this example, users can search for specific files or folders, navigate through pages if the directory is large, and click on individual nodes to view details or perform actions.
