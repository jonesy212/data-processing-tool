Subject-Based Organization: Implement a tagging or labeling system where each prompt is associated with one or more subjects or topics. This allows for easy categorization and organization of prompts based on the subjects they cover.

Conversation Linking: Create a mechanism to link prompts together to form conversations. Each conversation can consist of multiple prompts related to the same subject. This linking can be achieved through unique identifiers or references between prompts.

Document Management System: Develop a document management system where prompts, conversations, and associated documents/files are stored and organized. This system should allow users to upload, categorize, and manage documents/files related to specific subjects or conversations.

Access Control: Implement granular access control to regulate who can view, edit, or contribute to prompts, conversations, and associated documents/files. Users should be able to set permissions based on privacy/public settings, user roles, project/team memberships, and community access.

Search and Discovery: Enhance search functionality to allow users to search for prompts, conversations, and documents based on keywords, subjects, tags, or other metadata. Provide filtering options to refine search results and facilitate content discovery.

Automation: Integrate automation features to streamline the process of connecting content/files/folders together. This can include automated tagging of prompts based on content analysis, suggestions for related documents based on conversation topics, and recommendations for collaboration based on access control settings.

Community Documents: Implement a separate category or repository for community documents that are publicly accessible. Ensure that community documents are easily discoverable and distinguishable from private or restricted content.
