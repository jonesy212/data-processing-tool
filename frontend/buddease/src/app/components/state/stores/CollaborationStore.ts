    const manageCryptoWallet = () => {
        // Step 1: Retrieve User's Crypto Wallet Balances
        //   - Fetch the user's crypto wallet balances from the backend or a blockchain API.
        //   - Display the balances in the app's user interface for easy viewing.
      
        // Step 2: Display Transaction History
        //   - Retrieve the transaction history for the user's crypto wallets.
        //   - Display the transaction history in a chronological order, showing details such as
        //     transaction type (e.g., buy, sell, transfer), amount, date/time, and counterparties.
      
        // Step 3: Wallet Management Tasks
        //   - Allow users to perform various wallet management tasks, such as:
        //     - Adding new wallets: Provide an option for users to add new crypto wallets to their account.
        //     - Removing wallets: Allow users to remove existing wallets from their account if needed.
        //     - Setting up alerts: Enable users to set up alerts for specific wallet activities, such as
        //       receiving a large transaction or significant change in wallet balance.
      
        // Step 4: Error Handling and Feedback
        //   - Implement error handling mechanisms to handle any issues that may arise during wallet management tasks.
        //   - Provide feedback to users to confirm successful actions or alert them to any errors encountered.
      
        // Step 5: Security Considerations
        //   - Ensure that all wallet-related actions are performed securely to protect users' funds and sensitive information.
        //   - Implement authentication and authorization checks to verify users' identities before allowing access to wallet management features.
      
        // Step 6: User Experience Enhancements
        //   - Continuously improve the user experience by gathering feedback and iterating on the wallet management features.
        //   - Consider adding additional functionalities based on user requests and market trends in the cryptocurrency space.
      
        // Step 7: Testing
        //   - Thoroughly test the wallet management functionalities to identify and fix any bugs or issues before releasing them to users.
        //   - Test for edge cases, such as handling of large transaction volumes, network congestion, and unexpected user behavior.
      
        // Step 8: Documentation
        //   - Document the wallet management functionalities, including usage instructions, error handling procedures,
        //     and security best practices, to assist users and developers in understanding and using the features effectively.
      
        // Step 9: Deployment
        //   - Deploy the updated app with the new wallet management functionalities to production, ensuring seamless integration
        //     with existing features and minimal disruption to users.
      
        // Step 10: Monitoring and Maintenance
        //   - Monitor the performance and usage of the wallet management features in production.
        //   - Address any issues or concerns reported by users promptly and regularly update the functionalities as needed
        //     to maintain a high level of user satisfaction and platform reliability.
