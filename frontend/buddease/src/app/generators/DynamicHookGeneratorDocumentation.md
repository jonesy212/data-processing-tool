# Asynchronous Effect Cleanup in Project Management App

In the project management app, it's crucial to handle cleanup tasks after executing asynchronous effects to ensure smooth functionality and prevent memory leaks. This documentation provides an overview of how the `asyncEffect` function in the `createDynamicHook` component can be utilized for cleanup purposes.

## Purpose
The `asyncEffect` function is responsible for executing asynchronous effects in the project management app. After the execution of these effects, it's essential to perform cleanup tasks to reset state variables, clear intervals or timeouts, remove event listeners, and dispose of resources.

## Usage
The `asyncEffect` function accepts two parameters: `idleTimeoutId` and `startIdleTimeout`. These parameters are used to manage timeouts and execute cleanup tasks as needed.

### Example Usage
```typescript
asyncEffect: async ({ idleTimeoutId, startIdleTimeout }) => {
  await asyncEffect({ idleTimeoutId, startIdleTimeout });
  return () => {
    // Cleanup function:
    // Example 1: Resetting state variables
    // resetSomeState();

    // Example 2: Clearing intervals or timeouts
    if (intervalId !== undefined) {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    }
    if (timeoutId !== undefined) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    }

    // Example 3: Cleaning up event listeners
    // window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);

    // Example 4: Disposing resources or subscriptions
    // disposeResource();
  };
},
Scenario: Creating a New Project
When a user creates a new project in the app, the asyncEffect function is triggered to perform various asynchronous tasks, such as fetching project data from the server and initializing project resources. After completing these tasks, the cleanup function is executed to reset any temporary state variables and clear any unused resources.

Scenario: Real-Time Collaboration
During real-time collaboration sessions, the asyncEffect function is used to manage communication channels and synchronize updates across team members. After each collaboration session, the cleanup function ensures that communication channels are closed, and resources are released to maintain app performance.

Conclusion
By utilizing the asyncEffect function for cleanup tasks, the project management app ensures optimal performance and resource management, providing users with a seamless and efficient collaboration experience.

This documentation provides a detailed explanation of how the `asyncEffect` function can be used for cleanup tasks in various scenarios within the project management app. It includes code examples and scenarios to illustrate its usage effectively for users and developers.
