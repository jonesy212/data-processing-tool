To enhance the security of your email support feature and prevent abuse or attacks, you can implement some security measures and edge cases. Here are some suggestions:

File Type Restrictions:

Allow only specific file types for attachments (e.g., images, PDFs).
Reject or filter out executable file types (e.g., .exe, .bat) to prevent malware.
File Size Limit:

Set a reasonable size limit for attachments to prevent large files from overwhelming the system.
Consider compressing or resizing images on the server side to reduce the risk of large uploads.
Limit Number of Attachments:

Restrict the number of attachments a user can include in a single support request.
Content Filtering:

Implement content filtering to detect and block potentially harmful content in both email messages and attachments.
Rate Limiting:

Implement rate limiting to prevent rapid, repeated requests from the same user or IP address.
Validation and Sanitization:

Validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
Ensure that the entered email address is valid to prevent misuse.
CAPTCHA or Anti-Bot Measures:

Include CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to verify that the request is coming from a human and not an automated script.
Logging and Monitoring:

Implement logging of suspicious activities and monitor system logs for unusual patterns.
Set up alerts for potential security incidents.
Encryption:

Ensure that communication between the client and server is encrypted (HTTPS).
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the support system.
