## Animated Component with Cleanup and Async Hooker

The `AnimatedComponent` is a versatile component designed to handle animations and cleanup tasks effectively. It utilizes a dynamic hook generator and an async hook linker to manage asynchronous effects and cleanup operations seamlessly. Let's explore how these features enhance its functionality:

### Cleanup Mechanism:

The `createDynamicHook` function creates a dynamic hook that includes a cleanup function. This cleanup function ensures that resources are properly managed and released after executing asynchronous effects. Here's how it works:

```typescript
const { toggleActivation, startAnimation, stopAnimation, animateIn } = createDynamicHook({
  condition: async () => isVisible,
  asyncEffect: async () => {
    setIsVisible(true); // Perform async effect
  },
  resetIdleTimeout: () => {
    // Reset idle timeout if needed
  },
  isActive: false, // Initial isActive state
  cleanup: () => {
    // Cleanup function
    // Example cleanup tasks:
    // - Resetting state variables
    // - Clearing intervals or timeouts
    // - Removing event listeners
    // - Disposing resources or subscriptions
  },
});
Animation and Cleanup Integration:
The AnimatedComponent integrates animation functionality with the cleanup mechanism provided by the async hook. Here's how it combines animation and cleanup:

typescript
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  // Start animation after a specified animation time
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    startAnimation();
  }, animationTime);

  // Clear timeout to avoid memory leaks
  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [animationTime, startAnimation]);
Usage of Async Hook Linker:
The AnimatedComponent leverages the async hook linker to manage multiple async hooks efficiently. This ensures that cleanup tasks associated with each hook are executed appropriately. Here's how it utilizes the async hook linker:

typescript
Copy code
const { moveToNextHook, moveToPreviousHook } = useAsyncHookLinker({
  hooks: [/* List of async hooks */],
});
Summary:
The AnimatedComponent demonstrates how to integrate animation functionality with a robust cleanup mechanism using dynamic hooks and async hook linker. By leveraging these features, developers can create animated components that manage resources efficiently, prevent memory leaks, and provide a smooth user experience.

typescript
Copy code
<AnimatedComponent
  loopDuration={/* Specify loop duration */}
  loopLength={/* Specify loop length */}
  repeat={/* Specify repeat option */}
/>
This component serves as a valuable tool for developers building interactive and visually appealing interfaces within the project management app.
