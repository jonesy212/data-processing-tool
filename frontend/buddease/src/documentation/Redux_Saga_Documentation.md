Let's dive deeper into each aspect of the architecture by discussing the patterns and providing coding examples to illustrate how they work in practice.

MobX Store (General Store):

Pattern: MobX is utilized for local state management within each feature of your application.
Coding Example:
javascript
Copy code
// Example MobX Store for a Feature
import { makeAutoObservable } from "mobx";

class FeatureStore {
  // Define observable properties
  featureData = null;

  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this);
  }

  // Define actions to modify state
  updateFeatureData(newData) {
    this.featureData = newData;
  }
}

// Export instance of FeatureStore
const featureStore = new FeatureStore();
export default featureStore;
MobX Store Hook (useStore Hook):

Pattern: The useStore hook is a custom hook used to initialize and access MobX stores within components.
Coding Example:
javascript
Copy code
// Example useStore Hook
import { useContext } from "react";
import FeatureStore from "./FeatureStore";

const useStore = () => {
  return useContext(FeatureStoreContext);
};

export default useStore;
Redux Slice (General Slice):

Pattern: Redux is employed for global state management across features of your application.
Coding Example:
javascript
Copy code
// Example Redux Slice for a Feature
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const featureSlice = createSlice({
  name: "feature",
  initialState: {
    featureData: null,
  },
  reducers: {
    updateFeatureData(state, action) {
      state.featureData = action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { updateFeatureData } = featureSlice.actions;
export default featureSlice.reducer;
Redux Saga (General Sagas):

Pattern: Redux Saga serves as middleware for handling asynchronous actions and side effects.
Coding Example:
javascript
Copy code
// Example Redux Saga for a Feature
import { takeLatest, call, put } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { fetchFeatureDataSuccess, fetchFeatureDataFailure } from "./featureSlice";
import { fetchFeatureData } from "./api";

function* handleFetchFeatureData(action) {
  try {
    const featureData = yield call(fetchFeatureData, action.payload);
    yield put(fetchFeatureDataSuccess(featureData));
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(fetchFeatureDataFailure(error.message));
  }
}

function* featureSaga() {
  yield takeLatest("feature/fetchData", handleFetchFeatureData);
}

export default featureSaga;
By implementing these patterns, each feature of your application can manage its state locally using MobX while also interacting with the global state managed by Redux. Redux Saga handles complex asynchronous actions, such as fetching data from APIs, in a clean and declarative manner. This architecture promotes separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability in your application codebase.
