# Scenario Explanation

Imagine you are developing a user interface for a web application where users can configure certain settings with percentage values. For example, users might want to distribute some resource (like budget or time) into multiple segments, each represented as a percentage.

## Key Components

### Function `generatePresetPercentages`

**Purpose**: This function generates an array of percentage values.

**Parameters**:
- `numPercentages`: The number of percentage values to generate.
- `presetPercentages` (optional): An array of specific percentages to use instead of generating new ones.

**Behavior**:
- If `presetPercentages` is provided and its length matches `numPercentages`, it returns `presetPercentages`.
- Otherwise, it generates a default set of percentage values (e.g., 10%, 20%, 30%, etc., up to the specified `numPercentages`).

### Hook `usePresetPercentages`

**Purpose**: This custom React hook manages the state for the generated percentage values.

**Initial State**: Uses `generatePresetPercentages` to initialize with a default number of percentages.

**State Management**:
- `percentages`: The current array of percentage values.
- `handleNumPercentagesChange`: A function to update the percentages state based on user input.

**Behavior**:
- When the user changes the number of percentages (via an input field), `handleNumPercentagesChange` updates the state with the new set of percentages.

### Example Component

The `PresetPercentagesComponent` demonstrates how this hook can be used in a React component.

## User Scenario

### Initial State

When the component loads, it initializes with a default number of percentage values (e.g., 5), resulting in `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.

### User Interaction

The user sees an input field where they can enter the desired number of percentage values.
As the user changes this input (e.g., types `3`), the component updates to display `[10, 20, 30]`.

### Real-Time Update

The `handleNumPercentagesChange` function updates the state in real-time as the user changes the input value.
This ensures the displayed list of percentages always matches the user's specified number.

# Example Scenario: Budget Distribution Configuration

Imagine a web application used by a company's finance department to distribute the annual budget across various departments such as Marketing, Research & Development (R&D), Human Resources (HR), and Operations. The goal is to allow the finance team to input the percentage of the total budget allocated to each department and dynamically update this distribution.

## Detailed Explanation of the Components and Functionality

### Function to Generate Percentages

- Generates preset percentage values for the given number of departments.
- If specific preset percentages are provided, use those instead.

### Custom Hook for Managing Percentages

- Initializes and manages the state of percentage values.
- Provides a function to handle changes in the number of departments and update the state accordingly.

### Component to Display and Configure Budget Distribution

- Renders an input field for the user to specify the number of departments.
- Dynamically displays the list of departments with corresponding percentage values.
- Allows for easy updates and real-time feedback.

## Updated Code with Specific Example

### `presetPercentages.ts`





User Flow in This Example:
Component Mounts
The BudgetDistributionComponent initializes with the preset number of departments, e.g., 5, and calculates default percentages.

Initial State
The default state might be [20%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%] assuming an even distribution among the 5 departments.

User Input
The user can input the number of departments they want to allocate the budget to (e.g., enter 3).

State Update
handleNumPercentagesChange updates the state with the new number of percentages, e.g., [33.33%, 33.33%, 33.33%].

UI Update
The component re-renders, displaying the updated list of departments and their respective percentage allocations.

How This Helps in a Real-World Scenario:
Budget Allocation: Finance teams can quickly adjust budget allocations by specifying the number of departments and seeing the changes reflected in real-time.
Flexibility: The tool adapts to different numbers of departments dynamically, providing flexibility in budget planning.
Real-Time Feedback: Instant updates ensure that any changes are immediately visible, helping users make informed decisions quickly.
By incorporating such a component, the web application becomes a powerful tool for budget planning and management, enhancing the user's ability to efficiently allocate resources.

User-Friendly Explanation
Scenario
Imagine you are a finance manager at a company. You need to distribute the annual budget across various departments like Marketing, R&D, HR, and Operations. You want a tool that lets you easily input the number of departments and see the budget percentage allocated to each department.

How It Works
Initial State:

When you open the tool, it shows a default distribution of the budget. For example, if there are 5 departments, it might show [20%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%].
User Input:

You see an input field where you can enter the number of departments you want to allocate the budget to.
As you type the number of departments (e.g., 3), the tool updates the budget distribution in real-time. For example, it might show [33.33%, 33.33%, 33.33%].
Real-Time Update:

The tool ensures that the displayed budget percentages always match the number of departments you specified.
This means you can quickly see how the budget is distributed without having to manually calculate percentages.
Example Scenario: Budget Distribution
Imagine you are using this tool to distribute the budget for the following departments: Marketing, R&D, HR, Operations, and Sales.

When you first open the tool, it shows an even distribution of the budget, such as [20%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%].
You decide that you only want to allocate the budget to 3 departments. You type 3 in the input field.
The tool updates to show [33.33%, 33.33%, 33.33%], indicating an even distribution among the 3 departments.
How This Helps
Quick Adjustments: You can easily change the number of departments and instantly see how the budget is reallocated.
Flexibility: The tool adapts to different numbers of departments, making it flexible for various budgeting scenarios.
Informed Decisions: Real-time updates help you make informed decisions quickly, ensuring efficient budget allocation.
By using this tool, you can streamline the budget planning process and ensure that resources are allocated efficiently across departments.
