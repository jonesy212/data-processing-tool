MobX_Documentation
Let's discuss the general pattern of state management and asynchronous action handling in your application using MobX for local state management and Redux for global state management with Redux Saga for handling asynchronous actions.

MobX Store (General Store):

Description: MobX is utilized for local state management within each feature of your application.
Benefits:
Simplicity: MobX provides a straightforward way to define and observe state changes within each feature.
Observability: MobX automatically tracks dependencies, ensuring that components are updated when relevant state changes occur.
Explanation:
Each feature of your application has its own MobX store responsible for managing its specific state.
Stores are defined using classes, with observable properties and methods for manipulating state.
MobX actions are used to modify state, ensuring that changes are automatically detected and propagated to components.
MobX Store Hook (useStore Hook):

Description: The useStore hook is a custom hook used to initialize and access MobX stores within components.
Benefits:
Encapsulation: The hook encapsulates the creation and usage of MobX stores, making them easily accessible across components within each feature.
Explanation:
The useStore hook is used within components to obtain instances of the corresponding MobX stores.
It abstracts away the implementation details of store creation, providing a clean interface for accessing feature-specific state.
Redux Slice (General Slice):

Description: Redux is employed for global state management across features of your application.
Benefits:
Predictability: Redux ensures predictable state changes through reducers, facilitating centralized state management.
Middleware Support: Redux middleware like Redux Saga can handle complex asynchronous logic and side effects.
Explanation:
Redux slices are defined for each feature to manage global state related to that feature.
Reducers within each slice handle synchronous state changes, while asynchronous actions are managed using middleware like Redux Saga.
Redux Saga (General Sagas):

Description: Redux Saga serves as middleware for handling asynchronous actions and side effects.
Benefits:
Declarative: Redux Saga allows for writing asynchronous logic in a synchronous-like manner using generator functions.
Cancellation: Sagas support cancellation and can handle complex asynchronous flows with ease.
Explanation:
Sagas are defined to handle asynchronous actions within each feature, such as making API calls or handling complex asynchronous logic.
Sagas listen for specific actions dispatched by components or other parts of the application and execute corresponding logic.
Overall, the combination of MobX for local state management within each feature and Redux for global state management, along with Redux Saga for handling asynchronous actions, provides a robust and scalable architecture for your application. This pattern promotes separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability across all features of your application.
