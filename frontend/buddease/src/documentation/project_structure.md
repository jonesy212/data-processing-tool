# Project Structure Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the project structure, highlighting key components and their responsibilities. Understanding the organization of the codebase is crucial for developers who are new to the project or seeking insights into its architecture.

## Separation of Concerns

The project exhibits a robust separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

### 1. Redux-Saga for Side Effects

- **Responsibility:** Manages side effects and asynchronous logic.
- **Implementation:** Sagas handle API calls and other asynchronous operations independently, ensuring clean separation and maintainability.

### 2. MobX for State Management

- **Responsibility:** Manages application state.
- **Implementation:** MobX is employed for state management, handling business logic related to task management, such as adding, removing, and updating tasks.

### 3. Redux Toolkit for Redux Logic

- **Responsibility:** Manages Redux actions and reducers.
- **Implementation:** Utilizes Redux Toolkit for creating slices and managing actions and reducers in a concise manner, reducing boilerplate code.

### 4. React Component State

- **Responsibility:** Manages UI-related states within React components.
- **Implementation:** Local component state is used in specific cases for handling UI-related logic.

### 5. Generators for Code Generation

- **Responsibility:** Ensures consistent code generation.
- **Implementation:** Generators for actions, slices, store, and reducers promote consistency and reduce manual boilerplate code.

### 6. Use of Hooks

- **Responsibility:** Manages state within functional components.
- **Implementation:** Adheres to modern React best practices by using hooks for state management.

### 7. API Calls in Sagas

- **Responsibility:** Handles API calls.
- **Implementation:** API calls are centralized in sagas, keeping components focused on rendering and user interactions.

### 8. Notification Handling

- **Responsibility:** Manages and displays notification messages.
- **Implementation:** Centralized notification handling in the store provides a consistent way to manage and display notifications.

### 9. SnapshotStore

- **Responsibility:** Manages historical states.
- **Implementation:** The `SnapshotStore` is responsible for handling snapshots, facilitating the management of historical states.

## Conclusion

The project structure is designed with a focus on clarity, modularity, and maintainability. Developers are encouraged to follow established patterns and practices to ensure a cohesive and scalable codebase.
