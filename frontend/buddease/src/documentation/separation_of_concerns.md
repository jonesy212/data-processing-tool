The project exhibits a robust separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

1. Redux-Saga for Side Effects
Responsibility: Manages side effects and asynchronous logic.
Implementation: Sagas handle API calls and other asynchronous operations independently, ensuring clean separation and maintainability.
2. MobX for State Management
Responsibility: Manages application state.
Implementation: MobX is employed for state management, handling business logic related to task management, such as adding, removing, and updating tasks.
3. Redux Toolkit for Redux Logic
Responsibility: Manages Redux actions and reducers.
Implementation: Utilizes Redux Toolkit for creating slices and managing actions and reducers in a concise manner, reducing boilerplate code.
4. React Component State
Responsibility: Manages UI-related states within React components.
Implementation: Local component state is used in specific cases for handling UI-related logic.
5. Generators for Code Generation
Responsibility: Ensures consistent code generation.
Implementation: Generators for actions, slices, store, and reducers promote consistency and reduce manual boilerplate code.
6. Use of Hooks
Responsibility: Manages state within functional components.
Implementation: Adheres to modern React best practices by using hooks for state management.
7. API Calls in Sagas
Responsibility: Handles API calls.
Implementation: API calls are centralized in sagas, keeping components focused on rendering and user interactions.
8. Notification Handling
Responsibility: Manages and displays notification messages.
Implementation: Centralized notification handling in the store provides a consistent way to manage and display notifications.
9. SnapshotStore
Responsibility: Manages historical states.
Implementation: The SnapshotStore is responsible for handling snapshots, facilitating the management of historical states.

"Utilizing MobX reactions in our application contributes to the effective separation of concerns. Reactions allow us to respond to changes in the state of our MobX stores without directly coupling components or actions. By employing reactions, we establish a clear separation between the logic responsible for managing state (handled by MobX stores) and the reactions or side effects triggered by state changes. This approach enhances the maintainability and scalability of our project, as it promotes a modular structure where components and functionalities remain focused on their specific roles. Reactions enable a more robust and flexible architecture, fostering a clean separation of concerns within our project."
