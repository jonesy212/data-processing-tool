# User Journey: Managing Resources in the Collaboration System

## User Creates a Project:
- The user logs into the collaboration system and creates a new project.
- As part of the project setup, the user identifies various resources required for the project, such as documents, images, or tools.

## Adding Resources to the Project:
- Once the project is created, the user navigates to the project dashboard.
- Within the project dashboard, there's an option to manage resources.
- The user clicks on the "Manage Resources" section and sees a list of available resources.
- The user decides to add new resources by uploading documents, links, or other relevant files.

## Sharing Resources with Team Members:
- After adding resources, the user wants to share them with team members.
- The user selects specific resources and clicks on the "Share" button.
- A dialog box appears, allowing the user to choose team members or groups to share the resources with.
- The user confirms the selection, and the resources are now shared with the selected team members.

## Accessing Resources During Project Collaboration:
- Team members involved in the project can access the shared resources from the project dashboard.
- They navigate to the project dashboard and click on the "Resources" tab.
- A list of shared resources associated with the project is displayed.
- Team members can view, download, or interact with the resources based on their permissions.

## Updating and Managing Resources:
- As the project progresses, team members may need to update or manage the shared resources.
- The user who initially shared the resource or other authorized team members can edit or update the resources.
- They can upload new versions, add comments, or modify resource details as needed.

## Removing Resources:
- If a resource becomes obsolete or irrelevant to the project, users can remove it from the project's resources.
- The user selects the resource to be removed and clicks on the "Delete" or "Remove" option.
- A confirmation dialog appears to confirm the deletion, and upon confirmation, the resource is removed from the project.

## Tracking Resource Usage and Engagement:
- The collaboration system provides analytics or insights into resource usage and engagement.
- Users can view metrics such as the number of downloads, views, or interactions with each resource.
- This data helps project managers and team leaders understand the relevance and impact of resources on project collaboration.

## Integration with Tasks and Communications:
- Resources are seamlessly integrated with tasks and communications within the collaboration system.
- Team members can attach resources to tasks, share them in communication channels, or reference them during discussions.
- This integration streamlines project workflows and ensures that resources are easily accessible within relevant contexts.
