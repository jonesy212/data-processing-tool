HTTPS For Data Transmission
Ensure all data transmitted during the login process is encrypted. This is crucial for protecting sensitive information like passwords. Use HTTPS instead of HTTP in your Flask application.

In production, set up an SSL certificate for your domain and ensure your server is configured to handle HTTPS request

















Running The Tests
Finally, run the tests to validate the functionality of your login system.

python -m unit_test discover


Incorrect User Authentication Handling
Issues with User Authentication often stem from incorrect handling of credentials. Verify that your user authentication logic correctly matches usernames and passwords with the database records.

user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
if user and check_password_hash(user.password, password):
    # Correct handling







Session Management Problems
Problems with Session Management can lead to users not being able to stay logged in. Ensure your session secret key is set and that user IDs are correctly stored and retrieved from sessions.

app.secret_key = so.urandom(24)  # Make sure this is set

session['user_id'] = user.id  # Storing user ID in session


CSRF Token Issues
CSRF Token errors can occur if the CSRF token is missing or incorrect. When using Flask-WTF, ensure that the CSRF token is included in your login forms.

<form method="post">
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}  <!-- Include CSRF token -->
    <!-- Form fields -->
</form>



Debugging Flask Applications
Use Flask's built-in debugger to get detailed error messages and stack traces for exceptions.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
